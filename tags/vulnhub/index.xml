      <description>Raven: 1 - Writeup Summary This machine was well constructed and straight forward, therefore I really enjoyed it. After finding wordpress on the web server, it can be enumerated in order to find out valid usernames. The usernames can then be used to bruteforce the password for the ssh login. While on the machine, we can find mysql credentials in the wordpress config file. Inside the database, we can find the password hash for the other user, which can be cracked within seconds.</description>

      <description>Matrix: 1 - Writeup Summary I am a big Matrix fan and hoped to have funny hours with this machine, as this machine was labelled with intermediate difficulty. Unfortunately, it took me about 30 minutes to read root.txt. Anyhow, in the end I enjoyed the machine. We are given 3 open ports, whereas two of them are web servers. On one of the web servers we can see a comment in base64, pointing us to a file, which is encoded in Brainfuck.</description>

      <description>Mr. Robot - Writeup Summary For initial foothold, I had to get access to Wordpress as admin user and edit the php file of a plugin in order to get a reverse shell. For root user, there was an old nmap with suid bit, which allowed executing commands in interactive mode.
Netdiscover First, find out the IP address of the victim machine. Therefore Iâ€™am using netdiscover:

      <description>Kioptrix 4 - Writeup Summary In order to have a foothold into this machine, I had to use SQL injection. This allowed me to gather logon credentials over ssh. After logging in over ssh, I landed in a restricted shell, which was easily escaped with os.system. I discovered, that MySQL is running as root, which also allowed us to execute system commands through MySQL User Defined Functions.
Netdiscover First of all, lets find the ip address of the vulnerable machine:</description>

      <description>Kioptrix 3 - Writeup Summary An easy machine, which can be exploited with a remote code execution vulnerability. While on the machine, we can gather logon credentials from the database, which can be used for ssh login. Privilege escalation can be done with executing a command with sudo.
Netdiscover First of all, lets find the ip address of the vulnerable machine:

      <description>Kioptrix 2 - Writeup Summary Easy machine, which is vulnerable to SQL injection, that gives the possibility to get a reverse shell. While on the machine, we can execute a kernel exploit, that gives us root privileges.

      <description>Kioptrix 1 - Writeup Summary Very easy machine which is vulnerable to remote code exeuction on samba. Maybe there are different ways too, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried out right now.
